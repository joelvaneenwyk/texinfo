<p>GNU Texinfo is <em>free software</em>; this means that everyone is free
to use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  Texinfo
is not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of Texinfo that they might get from you.
</p>
<p>Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of the programs that relate to Texinfo, that you receive source
code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.
</p>
<p>To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the Texinfo related programs, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.
</p>
<p>Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to Texinfo.
If these programs are modified by someone else and passed on, we want
their recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.
</p>
<p>The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently
being distributed that relate to Texinfo are found in the General
Public Licenses that accompany them.  This manual is covered by the
GNU Free Documentation License (see <a href="GNU-Free-Documentation-License.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>).
