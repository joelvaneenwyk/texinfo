Must have GTK 3 development files installed and libwebkit2gtk-4.0.

Run ./autogen.sh after git checkout.

Then configure and make.

Set INFO_HTML_DIR to the directory containing the documentation files.
Each manual is in its own directory, named with the name of the manual.
For links to work, create an empty file with "touch dummy" and create
the manuals with e.g.

texi2any -c HTMLXREF=dummy --html  --no-number-sections ../../../hello.texi

The HTMLXREF option makes inter-manual links begin with "../".  (Texinfo 
6.7 needed if indices are to be found.)


Notes on architecture -

When a link is clicked, external links are blocked by 
main.c:decide_policy_cb.  file: links are intercepted in 
extension.c:request_callback.

If it's a link to a different manual, load_manual is called.
This in turn informs the main process that a new manual has been loaded 
via the socket.

The main thread should then do a ?top-node request in the hidden web 
view.  The top-node request should pass back a list of index nodes.

Then each of those should be used to give an index node to load.
